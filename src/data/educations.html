main-activities: {"My main responsibilities include: creating dynamic applications using React, Angular, and
Vue. When working with React, I use a microfrontend architecture, which enables building
modular and easily scalable applications. I maintain code quality through writing unit tests

both modern approaches using Signals and traditional patterns based on Observables and
RxJS."}}
